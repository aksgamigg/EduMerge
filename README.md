## 📝 Project Description

EduMerge is a lightweight, privacy-focused text editor built specifically for students and educators who need powerful document automation capabilities. Born from the frustration of bloated word processors and cloud-dependent tools, EduMerge offers a clean, distraction-free writing environment combined with intelligent mail merge functionality—all while keeping your data completely local.

The application addresses a real pain point in educational workflows: creating personalized documents for multiple recipients. Whether you're a teacher generating grade reports for 30 students, a student sending customized cover letters to different companies, or an administrator producing admission letters, EduMerge automates the tedious manual work. Built with Python and ttkbootstrap, it features rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, custom fonts, and colors), multi-format support (TXT, CSV, DOCX, PDF), and a tabbed interface for seamless file management.
